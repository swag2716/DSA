Ques :- Given an array A[] of size N and a positive integer K, find the first negative integer for each and every window(contiguous subarray) of size K.



/*****************************************/

1) We will take a queue in it

2) When we find the negative element then we will push it into the queue

3) when the window size hits we will check if the queue is empty we will print 0, else we will print front of queue

4) if front of queue is equal to the first element of window we will pop it as it cannot be the potential candidate for the next window
