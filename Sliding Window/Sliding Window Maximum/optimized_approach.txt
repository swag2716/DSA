Ques :- You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. 
You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.


/********************************************/

We have to find maximum of all subarray in it so we have to store the value of all the maximum element of the subarray and 
the next elements also as they can be the potential candidate for maximum element for the next window.

1) isme hum ek deque lenge aur usme pehla element push krenge

2) else phir hum check krenge kya humara jo j pe element h wo deque ki back se bada h kyuki phir wo chote waale element hamare potential candidate nhi honge,
   phir jab tak wo deque ki back se bada hoga hum usse pop kr denge, aur phir j waale element ko deque m push kr denge

3) agar hamari window size hit krti h to apne ans vector m deque ka front store krdenge aur phir check krenge kya deque ka front window k first element k 
   equal h, if equal front ko pop kr denge 


Ex :- [3, 1, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
      k = 3


Sol :- q = 3 1 -1 -3 5 3 6 7 (isme conditions k according element pop ho jaayenge, pop nhi karein h)
       ans = 3 1 5 5 6 7
